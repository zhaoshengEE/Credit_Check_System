## Description

Nowadays, running credit checks on customers becomes an essential step in many situations,
including house renting, bank loaning, credit card application, etc. Doing the credit check can
avoid serving the customer who is not creditable. Having learned the neural network, I decide to build up a two-layer neural network, which is used to classify the customers
as the person with good credit and the person with bad credit.


## Structure of the neural network

The neural network implemented in this project has an input layer, a hidden layer, and a output layer. The input layer has five neurons including a bias term. The hidden layer has four neurons including a bias term. The output layer has one neuron only. The bias terms in input layer and hidden layer is used to help the neural network best fit for the input data.
